/**
 * The data layer is a dictionary holding generic information about the
 * application. It uses a standard set of keys so it can be read by any party
 * that understands the specification. The data layer state is updated
 * through its API. For example, an app might start with the following
 * dataLayer:
<pre>
 *   {
 *     title: "Original screen title"
 *   }
</pre>
 *
 * As the state/data of an app can change, the app can update the dataLayer with a call such as:
<pre>
 *   [dataLayer push:@{@"title": @"New screen title"}];
</pre>
 *  Now the data layer contains:
<pre>
 *   {
 *     title: "New screen title"
 *   }
</pre>
 * After another push happens:
<pre>
 *   [dataLayer push:@{@"xyz": @3}];
</pre>
 * The dataLayer contains:
<pre>
 *   {
 *     "title": "New screen title",
 *     "xyz": 3
 *   }
</pre>
 * The following example demonstrates how array and map merging works. If the
 * original dataLayer contains:
<pre>
 *   {
 *     "items": @[@"item1", [NSNull null], @"item2", @{@"a": @"aValue", @"b": @"bValue"}]
 *   }
</pre>
 * After this push happens:
<pre>
 *   [dataLayer push:@{@"items":
 *       @[[NSNull null], @"item6", kTAGDataLayerObjectNotPresent, @{@"a": [NSNull null]}]}
</pre>
 * The dataLayer contains:
<pre>
 *   {
 *     "items": @[[NSNull null], @"item6", @"item2", @{@"a": [NSNull null], @"b": @"bValue"}]}
 *   }
</pre>
 * <p>Pushes happen synchronously; after the push, changes have been reflected
 * in the model.
 * <p>When an <code>event</code> key is pushed to the data layer, rules for tags
 * are evaluated and any tags matching this event will fire.
 * For example, given a container with a tag whose firing rules is that "event"
 * is equal to "openScreen", after this push:
<pre>
 *   [dataLayer push:@{@"event", @"openScreen"}];
</pre>
 * that tag will fire.
