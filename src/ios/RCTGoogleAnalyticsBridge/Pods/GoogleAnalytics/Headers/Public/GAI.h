 (returning kGAIDispatchError).  If there is no network connection or there is no data to send,
 kGAIDispatchNoData is returned.

 Note that calling this method with a non-nil completionHandler disables periodic dispatch.
 Periodic dispatch can be reenabled by setting the dispatchInterval to a positive number when
 the app resumes from the background.

 Calling this method with a nil completionHandler is the same as calling the dispatch
 above.

 This method can be used for background data fetching in iOS 7.0 or later. It would be wise to
 call this when the application is exiting to initiate the submission of any unsubmitted
 tracking information.
