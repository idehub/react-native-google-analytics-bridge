  * Is visitors/screens not showing up on GA? Read this guide: https://github.com/idehub/react-native-google-analytics-bridge/wiki/Creating-a-Google-Analytics-property-for-mobile-analytics
  Also, if you're using tracker.dryRun(true) then nothing will show up. Please read the docs.

  * Is your error: "TypeError: Cannot read property 'trackScreen' of undefined"
  Or some other property than trackScreen? 99% of the time that is because of failure during installation or linking.
  Please try again, and review the manual installation guide:
  https://github.com/idehub/react-native-google-analytics-bridge/wiki/Manual-installation
  Are you using Expo/create-react-native-app? This library does not work with Expo.
  Are you getting this error while running tests? You have to mock the library.
